1. tells git what to ignore, things that are not part of your source code or build files, things like .class files, .jar, or .project

2. merge changes from one branch into another without conflicts, whether because those conflicts are already resolved or because the branch being merged into hasn't changed in those areas

3. There should always be a stable build, and separate branches allow devs to work on tasks without stepping on each others toes.

4. Usually 1, sometimes more, but usually 1
